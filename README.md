# SoccerHut

#Inspiration
    My inspiration for this app came from a daily event I do mostly everyday. That event is checking if my favorite soocer teams are playing and checking out the scoreboard. Recently, I've gotten annoyed of constently having to go on google and having to search for each of my soccer teams. Thus came the inspiration, I wanted to create an app/website where you can find all your favorite teams or leagues in a quicker way. (When finished)SoccerHut will tell you live games occurring and any past games that have occurred. For right now, I'll only be focusing on soocer, but hopefully soon I can move on to adding other sports.
