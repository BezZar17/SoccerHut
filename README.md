# SoccerHut

# Inspiration
    My inspiration for this app came from a daily event I do mostly everyday. <br>That event is checking if my favorite soocer teams are playing and checking out the scoreboard. <br> Recently, I've gotten annoyed of constently having to go on google and having to search for each of my soccer teams.<br> Thus came the inspiration, I wanted to create an app/website where you can find all your favorite teams or leagues in a quicker way.<br> (When finished)SoccerHut will tell you live games occurring and any past games that have occurred. <br>For right now, I'll only be focusing on soocer, but hopefully soon I can move on to adding other sports.

# How to use
    This app is really simple to use. <br>You'll be given a few leagues around the world in which you can view current and past scores. <br>If you want to make this page feel a big like yours, go ahead and create your own profile and favorite your favorite leagues and teams.

# Unfinished Functionalities
    This app is yet to be completed.
    Major setback has to do with the backend and implementing an API.
